SUMMARY
Software Engineer with over 1.5 years of experience architecting scalable enterprise applications and end-to-end AI/ML
solutions. Expert in bridging the gap between backend development and Machine Learning, with a focus on Large
Language Models (LLMs), RAG pipelines, and MLOps. Proven track record of deploying high-impact intelligent systems
via CI/CD and AWS, delivering production-ready code in fast-paced Agile environments.
EXPERIENCE
Bajaj Finserv Direct Ltd Pune, India
Software Engineer Jul 2023 - Aug 2024
• Re-engineered a normalizedPostgreSQLdatabase architecture and indexing strategy for a high-volume fintech plat-
form to optimize data retrieval, achieving a40% improvement in query performance.
• Engineered a real-timeJava analytics dashboardwith integrated JPA/Hibernate to automate tracking of application
approval trends,reducing manual stakeholder reporting effort by 30%.
• ConductedA/B testingon competing user onboarding flows to identify and eliminate friction points in the registration
process, resulting in a15% increase in user conversion.
Bajaj Finserv Direct Ltd Pune, India
Software Engineer Intern Jan 2023 - Jun 2023
• Built an asynchronous rapid onboarding pipeline usingJava Spring BootandAWS SQS/SNSto handle high-velocity
customer data ingestion, successfullyreducing total onboarding latency by 60%.
• Partnered with Product Owners in anAgile sprintto architect aBulk Upload feature via AWS S3, streamlining
multi-user data processing andeliminating 95% of manual data entry errors.
• Streamlined the deployment lifecycle by resolving 450+ technical debt issues and maintaining 90% JUnit coverage,
leveragingCI/CD pipelinesto ensure99.9% system uptimefor data-critical services.
PROJECTS
Phishing Website Detection Pipeline–Python, Airflow, MLflow, AWS, Docker GitHub↗
• Architected an automatedMLOps pipelineusingAirflowandMLflowto evaluateSVM, Logistic Regression, and
Gradient Boosting, streamlining feature selection to achieve an0.98 F1-scoreand eliminate training bottlenecks.
• Engineered a robustCI/CD workflowviaGitHub ActionsandDockerfor deployment toAWS EC2, enablingreal-
time inferenceand ensuring seamless production updates with minimal deployment overhead.
Multi-Agent RAG Pipeline with Dynamic Routing–LangGraph, Python, Hugging Face, ChromaDB, Groq GitHub↗
• Orchestrated amulti-agent frameworkusingLangGraphto route queries between private data and public search,
overcoming static LLM limits via specialized agents to ensurehigh response accuracy.
• Developed a retrieval engine usingHugging FaceandChromaDBfor persistent memory, achievinghigh-speed
retrievaland improved contextual awareness for complex private data queries.
Natural Language SQL (Text-to-SQL) Agent–LangChain, LangSmith, Llama-3, Groq GitHub↗
• Designed aRAG-based SQL agentviaLangChainfor aStudent Database, optimizing query accuracy through
systematicLangSmithtracing and reasoning analysis for non-technical users.
• IntegratedLlama-3 (Groq)for low-latency streaming inference to create an "instant-reply" experience,significantly
reducing query latencyand allowing for real-time analytics without manual SQL intervention.
